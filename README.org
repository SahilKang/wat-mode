** Summary
  /wat-mode/ is an Emacs major mode for [[https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/bikeshed/index.html#text-format%E2%91%A0][WebAssembly's text format]] based on
  /lisp-mode/. It currently supports:
    + syntax highlighting for all core WebAssembly keywords including .wast, SIMD, and threading extensions. 
    + s-expression indentation (from /lisp-mode/)
    + experimental macro assembler support

  /wat-mode/ can be helpful to those writing WebAssembly by hand. It pairs well
  with the [[https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt][WebAssembly Binary Toolkit]].
